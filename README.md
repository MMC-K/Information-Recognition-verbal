## Sentence-level Sentiment Analysis

The code was fine-tuned using the KE-T5 pre-trained language model and sentiment label data sets from AI-HUB, the National Institute of Korean Language, and etc.

The sentence-level sentiment label data set was used, and the model and training information are as follows.


#### How to use

1) Run the command below to download the model parameters (weights)
```bash
    python get_weight.py
```

1) Run the command below to perform a sentiment analysis
```bash
    CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES='0' python test.py --model_type T5-mean-m
```
